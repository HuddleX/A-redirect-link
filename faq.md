## FAQ

***

##### Open the GUI
Press <kbd>Y</kbd>.

You can change this with `;bind clickgui rshift`

##### Bind modules
Run `;bind <module> <key>`.

You can unbind modules with <kbd>backspace</kbd> or <kbd>delete</kbd> in the GUI or by running `;bind <module> none`

You can also use `;bind modifiers on` to allow modules to be bound to keybinds with modifiers, e.g <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>w</kbd> or <kbd>ctrl</kbd><kbd>c</kbd>.

##### Use commands
The default prefix is <kbd>;</kbd>. Commands are used through chat, use `;commands` for a list of commands.

##### Baritone

To use Baritone, use the `;b` command

##### Show HUD elements on screen
In order to show HUD elements on screen when the GUI is closed, hit the pin in the top left of it.

##### Change command prefix
By using the command `;prefix <new Prefix>` (eg `;prefix .`) or after having ran seyfert (make sure it's closed), editing your configuration file (find it using `;config path` in-game) and changing the value of `commandPrefix` to change the prefix.

##### Will there ever be a version for newer Minecraft versions?
No, Seyfert's codebase is too big and relies on Forge events way too much to port to a newer version. Instead, you can use [KAMI](https://kamiclient.com), a 1.16.x client like seyfert.

##### Missing menus
Run `;fixgui` and if that doesn't help, make your GUI Scale smaller through the Minecraft settings and move your stuff back on screen.
